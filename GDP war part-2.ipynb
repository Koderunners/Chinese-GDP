    "# The factors afffecting the GDP per capita of a country are :-\n",
    "# 1> Population quality\n",
    "     This includes citizen's health and education levels. In both the criteria, India has to work harder to compete with China, A population health determines what the labourforce is capable of.\n",
    "      \n",
    " # 2>Political stability\n",
    "     Political Instability in government scares away a large quantity of investors who want to invest   in the country's progression, but due to uncertainity of fruitfull returns, they pull out their    money and try to seek for higher returns. A goverment should be capable of gainng trust from the investors if it wants to grow heavily. Indian government is very unstable in compared to China's . A huge amount of investments are lost due to this reason.\n",
    "       \n",
    " # 3>Religion  stability\n",
    "     India is fighting internally everyday on what things to eat, things to allow and which religion to follow. While in other hand, China is focused on its citizen's development and making policies for its economic growth.\n",
    "       \n",
    " #  4>Infrastructure\n",
    "     Increased investment in physical capital such as factories, machinery, and roads will lower the cost of economic activity. Better factories and machinery are more productive than physical labor. India's labourforce is highly unskilled and is not capable of producing enough income. Investing  in building more roads, hospitals, schools and ivesting in factories will help the country to boost its econony. An increase in investment in human capital an improve the quality of the labor force. This would result in an improvement of skills, abilities, and training. A skilled labor force has a significant effect on growth since skilled workers are more         productive.\n",
    " # 5>Technology          \n",
    "     Another influential factor is the improvement of technology. Technology could increase productivity with the same levels of labor, thus accelerating growth and development. This means factories can be more productive at lower costs. Technology is most likely to lead to sustained long-run growth."
